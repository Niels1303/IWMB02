Game Night Organizer is an app being developped as a university project. The purpose of this app is to offer a plattform
for friends to organize their game nights. Some of the required features are:
- the ability to create new game night events.
- the ability to suggest board games for the game nights.
- the ability to suggest type of foods for the game nights.
- the ability to communicate with fellow players.
- the ability to rate the games, the food and the evenings.

The App will be build via a classic Client-Server-Architecture. Instead of mocking the client-server communication, the
database will be hosted on "Backendless.com" and the Server will be accessed via its REST Api by creating a REST Api client
with the help of the "retrofit 2" library.
